  longDescription:
    "An Inverted V is a half-wave dipole with its arms sloping downward from a single " +
    "center support. The included angle between arms affects performance: " +
    "90-120 degrees is optimal. Feed impedance is lower than a flat dipole (typically 50-60 ohms) " +
    "which can be advantageous for direct coax feed. The radiation pattern is slightly more omnidirectional " +
    "than a flat dipole, with ~1 dB less maximum gain.",
