/**
 * Small Magnetic Loop antenna template.
 *
 * A small transmitting magnetic loop antenna. The loop circumference is
 * much less than a wavelength (<0.25 lambda). Tuned with a variable capacitor
 * placed opposite the feedpoint.
 *
 * Geometry (side view, XZ plane):
 *
 *         C (capacitor)
 *        _|_

 *     |   |   |  ← circular loop, radius R
 *      \  |  /
 *       \_|_/
 *         F (feed)
 *
 * The loop is a full circle in the XZ plane at a given center height.
 * NEC2 uses GA card for the wire arc.
 *
 * For 3D preview, the arc is approximated as short straight segments.
 * For simulation, the backend receives the arc as a GA card.

    "A small magnetic loop antenna (also called a small transmitting loop or STL) " +
    "is a full circle of conductor tuned to resonance by a high-voltage variable capacitor. " +
    "Despite its small size (typically 1-3 ft diameter for HF), it can be surprisingly " +
    "efficient on 40m-10m. The radiation pattern is broadside to the plane of the loop " +
    "(figure-8 in the plane of the loop). Key advantages: very compact, low-noise receiving, " +
    "sharp tuning rejects out-of-band interference. Key limitations: very narrow bandwidth " +
    "(a few kHz on 40m), high voltages at the capacitor (several kV at 100W).",
